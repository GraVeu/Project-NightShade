      "If you are reading this message, this is not a drill. Humanity is in a state of war. For the last few decades, we have been monitoring the recent developments in artificial intelligence of a race called the Elysians. Now that they have advanced farther than we ever thought possible they have declared war on the human race. You have been chosen as a volunteer participant in the new Cryo-Preservation project. It was designed to prolong the life of you and your team in the event of Earth’s downfall. Your cryopods have prolonged your lives in the base while the extraterrestrials attack on the surface. We've done all we can, now it's your turn to fight. Good luck, you are humanity’s last hope."
